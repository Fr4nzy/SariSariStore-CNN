Android-based POS System with Image Classification (CNN) and Predictive Analysis (ARIMA)

Start by using the Data Collection.ipynb, this source code collects the datasets for the Model. 

Then use the Data Processing.ipynb, this code proceeds to process the datasets into 224x224 images to provide clarity on the image being processed by the model.

Now, use the main code, which is the CNN Image Classification.ipynb file to load the datasets, augment the datasets, train the model, and evaluate the model.

The Data Modelling.ipynb file is just an extra measure to further modify the datasets to make it more complex to improve the predictions of the model when training.
